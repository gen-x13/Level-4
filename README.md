### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **fourth project**, and for a beginning, I'm proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me **3 days** to build the backbone of the program and **2 days** for the GUI.  
- I spent **5 days in total** learning and battling with streamlit (which has some limitations).

It was a great learning experience, especially for my understanding of **Streamlit** and patience.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught mindset and curiosity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code and visualization optimization, and move up to the next level.

### **💭 Possible Remake of that LEVEL:**  
I’m planning a future remake with:
- Interactive charts using Plotly,
- Custom buttons and components,
- More advanced visualizations,
- And eventually… a touch of Machine Learning.

"More advanced versions will come soon... Stay tuned! 👀✨"
